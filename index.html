            <h4>What do I stand for?</h4>
            <p>As a learner I believe all learning should be accessible, flexible and interactive. As a teacher, I believe my role is to push my learners beyond their comfort zone, reflect effectively, and practice their knowledge with passion. As a UX designer, I believe all experiences digitally and face to face should be accessible, fair, enjoyable and make you want to come back for more.</p>
            <h4>What is my work ethic like?</h4>
            <p>I do not do things by halves. As you will learn from the examples I present in my portfolio, working with me means always striving for more for yourself, and for the project we are working on. If you are one of those people that says <strong>that's not in my job description, we are not going to work well together</strong>. If you are full of valuable ideas for a project, and want to plan and execute them no matter what it takes to get them over the line, I'm there for it.</p>
            <h4>What do I do to stay sane?</h4>
            <p>My first passion and my first degree was music performance. I am a guitarist first and foremost, but can hold a tune, play a bit of piano, and drums and pretty much any instrument I can put my hands on. I play basketball on a Sunday night at Coomera, and watch games in the American basketball league (NBA) daily. When I need to wind down I play a bit of PlayStation. I love playing Assassin's Creed and NBA, and when I really feel like indulging my inner child I jump on Fortnite for a few rounds.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg">
            <h4>What's my story?</h4>
            <p>I started as a Learning Support (LS) Teacher in Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE in Brisbane, QLD. I was a mathematics support teacher for tradespeople - electricians, plumbers and engineers. Lucky I have a natural knack for maths! From here I was offered a spot designing and delivering programs for adult learners in work preparation skills, and refugees preparing to enter Australia as citizens. After a year of doing this work, in 2012 I moved to Melbourne where I continued my work as an LS Teacher and Music Teacher at North Melbourne Institute of TAFE. During this entire time, in the background I was refining my skills in Learning Design, building online and blended activities for adult learners in many music courses and work preparation courses.</p>
            <p>After 2 years of working with NMIT/Melbourne Polytechnic I started a new role at Box Hill Institute (BHI) as the Academic Advisor for international students. This is where I started to notice gaps in online resources at BHI for both domestic and international students. In particular how to research and reference effectively, and construct argumentative writing.</p>
            <p>I worked with BHI for 4 years, and converted my role to full time, ongoing, permanent...only to leave 2 months later and take a casual opportunity at Monash University with the Faculty of Arts. I was incredibly excited to get a shot at the highest level of education available in the country with such a reputable institution, working in all the fields I love - Music, Theatre, Languages, Social Sciences and all the Arts Faculty has to offer. After 3 months I then gained a permanent, full-time, ongoing role with the Faculty of Arts, and continued to work as an Educational Designer for 3 years at Monash...enter...the pandemic.</p>
            <p>I was lucky enough to have a son late in in 2019 and when the pandemic hit, my partner and I decided to return to QLD, not knowing when it would all end, and wanting to share our son with our extended family because he's a legend. I interviewed for 3 different positions at UQ, and it was Sam McKenzie - formerly the Project Manager for the eAssesment project - and Jacqui Lynagh, the current eAssessment Project Manager that saw my experience with upskilling teaching staff in the most difficult situation as a major asset to their team. I worked with eAssessment improving assessment in a number of courses using Inspera, and starting the design of staff professional development for improving assessment through using Inspera for just over a year before the Digital Learning Uplift (DLU) team had an opening and I took the opportunity to get back to full course design. Through working with the Medicine Faculty while being in the DLU I was offered a direct appointment as a full time learning designer and took it, because how often does an Arts major get a shot at working in Medicine or STEM?</p>
            <p>Now surpassing 10 years of experience as a teacher and learning designer since I first started in QLD at MSIT, I am looking to continue my work in the field, lead newcomers wherever possible and look for my first senior position in the field.</p>

The academic Frankie Egan, coordinating a unit for the first time, and I were given the challenge to <strong>design the ideal online learning unit that will set the example for a new generation of online offerings</strong> as a directive from the Associate Dean of Arts. This was in response to the lockdowns at the start of the pandemic where many students were forced to miss out on units that required face-to-face teaching; this unit would be one of the many alternatives offered in Arts.</p>

              <div class="col-lg">
                <p>I designed the very first element creator - the button builder - with my limited knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used this basic example to show two Educational Designers in the IT Faculty - Matt Chen and Philip Abramson - in IT with exceptional Educational Design, User Experience and coding skills - Matt a former front end web designer, Phil a former back end CMS expert - and convince them it was a worthwhile prospect building all the other elements you see on the BEEST.</p>
                <p>From here Matt and Phil built out the functionality, storage and hosting of the site, and I worked on the following:</p>
                <ul class="mb-0">
                  <li>Researching and implementing the user interface (UI) of the BEEST. I built and iterated the interface several times as I gained user feedback and research how people like to use applications like this.</li>
                  <li>I came up with the idea for naming and storing items for reuse, and Phil made this happen while also teaching me how to access local storage in the browser.</li>
                  <li>I worked with Matt to streamline the functionality so the BEEST works quicker with the user, learning about extraction of functionality and more advanced Javascript principles.</li>
                  <li>I recorded all the walkthrough screencasts and wrote all the user guides.</li>
                  <li>I coordinated 4 focus groups - other Educational Designers, Academics from Arts, Students and Senior Teaching and Learning staff - to gain and incorporate their feedback into the product. In the process winning many senior staff over that we can trust staff with working with code, that the product is self-sufficient.</li>
                  <li>Setup the Google Analytics to track use of the product. This was instrumental in proving self sufficiency. We audited 50 sites that used the BEEST in it's first semester of being public, the site was used in excess of 1000 times with only 4 inquiries for support, and only 6 instances where we found content from the BEEST that was used inappropriately - e.g. an accordion inside of another accordion.</li>

              <div class="col-lg">
                <p>Over 500 academics and professional staff across the university still use BEEST. But the real win here is that the central teaching and learning unit saw how useful BEEST was, and how many people were using it, and using it well without requiring the levels of support they expected. They decided to create their own tool, based off the BEEST that was built in to Moodle's backend rather than continuing to put BEEST in on the front end.</p>
                <p>The BEEST solved many problems in learning design to improve learning and user experience:</p>
                <ul class="mb-0">
                  <li>The big one in our eyes. All content built with the BEEST is responsive across devices. Students can now use Moodle with confidence on laptop/desktop, tablets and mobile.</li>
                  <li>It cuts out the need for staff to learn complex HTML to build complex HTML elements.</li>
                  <li>It harnesses in built Bootstrap and Font Awesome library in Moodle to create these elements. It only adds extra CSS for Accordions and Tabbed content to ensure it works correctly in Moodle. All other elements require no additional external CSS or Javascript to operate.</li>
                  <li>Elements can be saved and revisited and updated. Making elements reusable is another user efficiency we were able to make happen using the browser's local storage capacity. Each item is around 1-4kb of memory and most browsers allow 10MB of local storage per site. Meaning we can store between 2500-10000 BEEST items per user in their browser and not pay for server space.</li>
                  <li>It allows us as Educational Designers to speak more to a user experience perspective of learning. Asking questions like 'is how you have formatted this really allowing to student to get the best out of their time?' This is what learning online is missing in many cases where it goes wrong. A user experience that is clear, precise and smooth for the learner. BEEST can help here to reduce the learning curve for newcomers.</li>

This means we are combining the themes, content and assessment of 8 x 12-week courses into 1 x 32-week course. This redesign has been prompted by doctors in the field and current students raising concerns that the areas of learning are not integrated well enough. Students are out practicing using compartmentalised knowledge, rather than applying their skills holistically to each given situation. In an attempt to rectify this, the entire program has been reduced to its fundamentals for year one and put back together again.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">I am also using the learnings from my project on the BEEST at Monash to bring responsive design and incorporating quality user experience into the learning design to UQ's Medicine course. I have designed a similar application for UQ's LearnX and added Bootstrap, FontAwesome and custom CSS and JS to the platform to produce a LearnX course that is responsive across devices. The working title is the MEDI7100 Code Centre - <a title="MEDI7100 Code Centre" href="medi7100codecentre.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view the code centre here</a>. I have built, iterated and continue to maintain this web application. Because it is built based on Bootstrap v5.2, and we are referencing this library in LearnX, there will be very little maintainence required due to the static nature of this library. I have begun to develop Professional Development (PD) for academic and professional staff, which includes recent research around user experience so that they can utilise this web application to build learning that meets their brief, plus is an interesting user experience for the students without the need to code.</p>

              <p>Initially, students and staff were dubious of the program's success. Integrating such a broad spectrum of knowledge and skills while maintaining the standards set by UQ would result in chaos, and frustrated stakeholders. After 18 months of planning, and 10 weeks of the program being delivered, opinions of all the critical stakeholders has shifted to accept the change, and students are excited. With the advent of a project team we are also getting a much quicker feedback loop with students on content organisation and assessment. This means closing feedback loops in hours, instead of weeks or whole iterations of a course.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">Students see the results of providing feedback and continue to be open with us about improving their experience. To me, this close relationship with the student base is the key to success of the change. If academics see students engaging and enjoying themselves, regardless of how much work is required to continue the program in this fashion they will do it. <strong>While there are no definitive results of success 10 weeks into the delivery</strong>, the murmurs of unwinding the changes and returning to the old delivery from academics and student reprasentatives alike have stopped.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">When all students and staff were sent home from Monash, music and performance students and staff faced a unique issue. So many of the courses relied on assessment of a live performance component. With the inability to be in the same space how would musicians form and perform in a band for their assessment? Even if they could, how would they submit? How would that submission be disseminated to relative markers? Enter myself as an Educational Designer in Arts working with the Music Faculty and Matt Chen, an Educational Designer from IT. Between us we used Google Suite and Apps Scripts to automate a huge amount of online work for music and drama assessment during Semester 1 of 2021, which prevented a complete shut down of the courses at the time.</p>

            <p>I wireframed the entire onine assessment and marking process for music performance, which was then applied to the theatre courses as well. The steps involved:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Sell my idea for online performance assessment to the Associate Dean for Education in Arts, Dean of the Music School and leader of Teaching Support for the Faculty of Arts.</li>
              <li>Engage Matt for support to execute the scripts required to fire off several steps automatically across the Google Suite</li>
              <li>Gather student data for assessment:
                <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                  <li>Student repertoire for the 6 performance units/200 students across 6 semesters</li>
                  <li>Connect students to relative markers. In performance at least 2 markers for each performance are required. A Monash staff member plus an instrumental specialist for the instrument the assessed student is playing</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>From here, the step-by-step process an assessment would pass through was as follows:</p>
            <ol class="mb-0">
              <li>Submit their repertoire listing for their performance unit, including their instrument and any accompanying artists via a Google Form</li>
              <li>Google then automatically created a folder for each student with subfolders for each piece of their repertoire plus a 
              for charts</li>
              <li>Each student then received an automated email linking to another form to upload their video-recorded performances</li>
              <li>Once the folders from step 2 were all populated with videos:
                <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                  <li>Students were sent a view link to their Google Drive folder to submit to Moodle</li>
                  <li>Matt and I were notified of the submission end date for each unit group. On this date, we used data that had all the markers' names, emails, students they were to mark, and instrumental specialty if they had one. We then automated injecting sharing permissions into the folders they were meant to have access to</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Once permissions were injected, Google sent markers a document with a list of students to mark and dates that marks were due</li>
              <li>Once the date for markers to be completed was passed, students were then sent an automated email with a link to their marks and feedback</li>
              <li><strong>Note</strong>: Matt, the course coordinator, and I all had the ability to manually override due dates for individual students for extensions and markers to extend the individual marking deadline</li>

            <p>First and foremost, courses continued, students didn't get delayed, casual and contract staff didn't lose their jobs and all stakeholders gained incredible new skills to play and record together online. Secondly, the Faculty gained a highly automated process in the future for when students weren't able to perform live for whatever the reason may be. And finally, Matt, the music and theatre staff, and I all gained an incredible amount of experience dealing with high-stress students and technology none of us had used to this extent before.</p>
            <p>While overall compared to years where students could attend face to face, the quantitative feedback was down from an average of half a point, the comments from students in the qualitative feedback was overall incredibly grateful to all the staff for getting the job done in an incredibly difficult time, and not delaying students' progress further.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">Staff were overwhelmed with what Matt and I were able to achieve using the Google Suite. That two people could automate the work that should have had a team dedicated to it was something of a miracle, the right people with the right attitude and skillset in the right place at the right time. We minimised revenue loss, job losses, and time lost and created a process that was essentially reduced to clicking a few buttons at the right time to produce automations for the cohort. A win I am immensely proud of being a music student and musician myself.</p>

          <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>This paper explores the history of higher education (HE) and what has led to the current tense state, where instead of a balanced approach to managing and implementing quality teaching and research, there is pressure either directly or indirectly to favour research by HE providers. My approach was not to simply say that higher education needs to implement teaching heavy positions. Instead, it was to dive deeper into what makes research worthy of such favour, and how higher education in Australia can implement a similar path to balance value for teaching. The main discovery was systems that are in place to measure research, and rank universities based on their research are a priority of the universities themselves. If a rigorous system of reviewing and ranking teaching and learning quality could be created and put in place, we would see external ranking systems by independent bodies rank universities on teaching and learning quality as well as research quality. The main limitations of this study were the unclear nature of financial reports in relation to funding and expenditure on teaching and learning, and an absence of literature on higher education institutions implementing processes for measuring teaching and learning quality.

          <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>Exploring Experiential Learning (EL) and Community Service Learning (CSL) further to improve my own practice as an educator was the focus of this paper. While experiential learning is becoming more prevalent in its many forms such as Problem/Project Based Learning (PBL) and Social Justice Learning (SJL) I wanted to further understand how the theories that underpin these practices could possibly be applied to the international student experience in Australia. My findings were as follows. To implement a mentoring program and language exchange in the institution I was employed at would help solve two major issues; language acquisition and development, and exploitation of students in unfamiliar work and study conditions. All too familiar are stories of international students working 50+ hours a week, cash in hand, while studying full time, 20+ hours per week, to support themselves.</p>
          <p>Mentors who have been in the country for 2+ years could provide new students incredible insight into navigating Australia's system to ensure fairness and safety while in the country. Secondly, language acquisition, while encouraged in the student's home country to achieve a high enough level of confidence with language to attain a position in an Australian institution, tends to come to a halt once enrolled in study due to many competing factors for a student's time and also cultural differences. A language exchange would see local and international students share language knowledge, build relationships and counter the stagnation of language acquisition while also familiarising participants with unfamiliar cultural expectations and norms.

      <h3 class="text-center">What did I use to build this site?</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg">
          <h4 class="text-center"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> Github</h4>
          <p>Github is an online development hub. It also has a public pages space so you can build web pages - like this one - and applications - like BEEST and the Code Centre - all for free. The only catch with the free version is everyone gets to see your code, but that's what github is all about. Collaborating and innovating. Taking what other people have built and making it work to solve a problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg">
          <h4 class="text-center"><i class="fa-brands fa-bootstrap"></i> Bootstrap</h4>
          <p>Bootstrap is the most referenced design library on the internet. I have used it to style and format this site, the BEEST, the Code Centre and many other projects to improve user experience, look and feel of online products. Without Bootstrap this would all be a bunch of plain text on a page. Boring!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg">
          <h4 class="text-center"><i class="fa-solid fa-font-awesome"></i> Font Awesome</h4>
          <p>Font Awesome is the most highly used icon library on the internet. It was one of the first to be created, and has stood the text of time to get to version 6. <strong>Fun fact</strong>: it is the reason why so many icon libraries use the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element to display icons and why this element is no longer the standard for italics - instead we use the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element. The free version gives you access to just over 2000 icons. The full version has just over 20000 icons. It can take a good project and make it great.</p>
