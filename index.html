        <h4>What was the aim of this project?</h4>
        <p>This unit was a first of its kind in the Faculty of Arts. The academic Frankie Egan, coordinating a unit for the first time, and I were given the challenge to <strong>design the ideal online learning unit that will set the example for a new generation of online offerings</strong> as a directive from the ASsociate Dean of Arts. This was in response to the lockdowns at the start of the pandemic where many students were forced to miss out on units that required face to face teaching; this unit would be one of the many alternatives offered in Arts.</p>
        <h4>What was my role in the project?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Train and guide Frankie on backwards design of assessment and learning.</li>
          <li>Collaborate with Frankie to make decisions on assessment, learning and technology to use.</li>
          <li>Provide training as needed on Moodle, The Library Reading List tool (Talis at the time), Mahara (ePortfolio), H5P and use of the BEEST to develop responsive content.</li>
          <li>Setup student focus groups to test the assessment learning content, and collate and instigate their feedback.</li>
          <li>Develop and review the assessment and learning content on Moodle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What was the result?</h4> 
        <p>The assessment regime was as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>4 quizzes, 1 every 3 weeks at the end of a module - take the top 2 results - 20%.</li>
            <li>Completion of weekly lessons on Moodle. H5P tasks within the Moodle lessons gauged completion, plus the activity completion log in Moodle - 10%.</li>
            <li>6 'blog posts'. Short 250 word responses to each topic showing the student's ability to reflect and synthesise the content on Mahara - 30%.</li>
            <li>The single essay. Students were to select one of their blog posts and extend on their thoughts, supported by research to create one essay of 1500-2000 words - 40%.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The assessment was progressive. The content in the quizzes drew students attention to the main themes of the content for that module. The blog posts were extended responses that allowed them to reflect on their views without the need for research. The single essay was then their chance to delve deep into the research and compare their views on one topic with what the literature offered.</p>
          <p>The structure of learning content was as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>10 weekly lessons across 12 weeks and 2 live guest lectures/Q+A. During the semester this was extended to be 4 guests, because students provided feedback they wanted more on the various topics, so we found two more guests.</li>
            <li>The communication approach with students was to have a guest live early on to see faces online, and meet the students and engage them early, and follow this with discussion sessions on Moodle Discussion boards one afternoon per week to address content and technical questions.</li>
            <li>The content of the lessons was highly visual. Videos of Frankie lecturing on topics for 6-10mins followed by TED Talks or excerpts from interviews and documentaries. Minimising text was key to engagement success. Saving this cognitive load for reading supporting articles.</li>
            <li>Weekly content came with 'levels' for students to choose. There was basic - the minimum required to synthesise about that topic for that week, intermediate - all of basic plus a second reading, advanced - all of intermediate plus extra video, reading and interactive content.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As a result of this highly interactive and bespoke approach, the results you can click to see below speak for themselves. The highest rating of a first time unit coordinator and the highest rating the Arts Faculty had ever seen for a unit that was delivered solely online. The comments from students mostly show a positive response. Where there was a feel of being overwhelmed or overloaded, the student is clear about how this could have been rectified. A result that met the brief we were given and raised expectations of other units that were to be designed.</p>

        <h1 class="p-2 text-center">BEEST</h1>
        <h3 class="text-center">Simplifying advanced HTML element design</h3>
        <h4>What is the BEEST?</h4>
        <p>BEEST stands for Bootstrap Enhanced Elements Streamlining Tool. BEEST takes your input and combines it with pre-written HTML to generate advanced HTML elements for Moodle without the need for complex HTML skills. <a href="https://beest.monash.edu" target="_blank" title="Monash BEEST">Take a look at the current state of the project here</a>.</p>
        <h4>What problems does it solve?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The big one in our eyes. All content built with the BEEST is responsive across devices. Students can now use Moodle with confidence on laptop/desktop, tablets and mobile.</li>
          <li>It cuts out the need for staff to learn complex HTML to build complex HTML elements.</li>
          <li>It harnesses in built Bootstrap and Font Awesome library in Moodle to create these elements. It only adds extra CSS for Accordions and Tabbed content to ensure it works correctly in Moodle. All other elements require no additional external CSS or Javascript to operate.</li>
          <li>Elements can be saved and revisited and updated. Making elements reusable is another user efficiency we were able to make happen using the browser's local storage capacity. Each item is around 1-4kb of memory and most browsers allow 10MB of local storage per site. Meaning we can store between 2500-10000 BEEST items per user in their browser and not pay for server space.</li>
          <li>It allows us as Educational Designers to speak more to a user experience perspective of learning. Asking questions like 'is how you have formatted this really allowing to student to get the best out of their time?' This is what learning online is missing in many cases where it goes wrong. A user experience that is clear, precise and smooth for the learner. BEEST can help here to reduce the learning curve for newcomers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What was my role in the project?</h4>
        <p>I designed the very first element creator - the button builder - with my limited knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used this basic example to show two Educational Designers in the IT Faculty - Matt Chen and Philip Abramson - in IT with exceptional Educational Design, User Experience and coding skills - Matt a former front end web designer, Phil a former back end CMS expert - and convince them it was a worthwhile prospect building all the other elements you see on the BEEST.</p>
        <p>From here Matt and Phil built out the functionality, storage and hosting of the site, and I worked on the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Researching and implementing the user interface (UI) of the BEEST. I built and iterated the interface several times as I gained user feedback and research how people like to use applications like this.</li>
          <li>I came up with the idea for naming and storing items for reuse, and Phil made this happen while also teaching me how to access local storage in the browser.</li>
          <li>I worked with Matt to streamline the functionality so the BEEST works quicker with the user, learning about extraction of functionality and more advanced Javascript principles.</li>
          <li>I recorded all the walkthrough screencasts and wrote all the user guides.</li>
          <li>I coordinated 4 focus groups - other Educational Designers, Academics from Arts, Students and Senior Teaching and Learning staff - to gain and incorporate their feedback into the product. In the process winning many senior staff over that we can trust staff with working with code, that the product is self-sufficient.</li>
          <li>Setup the Google Analytics to track use of the product. This was instrumental in proving self sufficiency. We audited 50 sites that used the BEEST in it's first semester of being public, the site was used in excess of 1000 times with only 4 inquiries for support, and only 6 instances where we found content from the BEEST that was used inappropriately - e.g. an accordion inside of another accordion.c</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        <h4>What are the results?</h4>
        <p>Over 500 academics and professional staff across the university still use BEEST. But the real win here is that the central teaching and learning unit saw how useful BEEST was, and how many people were using it, and using it well without requiring the levels of support they expected. They decided to create their own tool, based off the BEEST that was built in to Moodle's backend rather than continuing to put BEEST in on the front end.</p>

        <h1 class="p-2 text-center">MD Design - Postgraduate Studies in Medicine</h1>
          <h5 class="text-center">Transforming how future doctors study</h5>
          <h4>What is this project?</h4>
          <p>UQ's Medicine Faculty is redesigning its postgraduate medicine course to be 4 year-long courses, rather than 32 individual courses. This means we are combining the themes, content and assessment of 8 x 12 week courses into 1 x 32-week course. This redesign has been prompted by doctors in the field and current students raising concerns that the areas of learning are not integrated well enough. Students are out practicing using compartmentalised knowledge, rather than applying their skills holistically to each given situation. In an attempt to rectify this, the entire program has been reduced to its fundamentals for year one and put back together again.</p>
          <h4>Who are the stakeholders?</h4>
          <p>The stakeholders in the Faculty of Medicine are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Academics collaborating on assessment and learning content and delivering classes</li>
            <li>Professional staff developing and maintaining learning content</li>
            <li>Administrative staff responding to student and staff enquiries</li>
            <li>The MD Project Team leading the design and development of the new program</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The stakeholders in the broader context of the university are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning designers and academics in other schools outside of the Faculty of Medicine; School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Public Health, School of Philosophy.</li>
            <li>The central teams supporting the project team, academics and professional staff; Digital Learning Uplift team, eLearning Support, IT Support</li>
            <li>The students studying the new program</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What is my role in the project?</h4>
          <p>This is my current full-time learning design role. I am currently working on the assessment regime for year two, and developing content in collaboration with the stakeholders above for year one and two in several subsections of the program:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Assessment Working Group; designing and developing the assessment schedule for years 1-4</li>
            <li>Clinical and Practical Skills</li>
            <li>Advocacy and Public Health</li>
            <li>Ethics and Law</li>
            <li>Rural and Remote Medicine</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I am also using the learnings from my project on the BEEST at Monash to bring responsive design and incorporating quality user experience into the learning design to UQ's Medicine course. I have designed a similar application for UQ's LearnX and added Bootstrap, FontAwesome and custom CSS and JS to the platform to produce a LearnX course that is responsive across devices. The working title is the MEDI7100 Code Centre - <a href="https://uq-itali.github.io/uqlearnx/medi7100codecentre.html" target="_blank" title="MEDI7100 Code Centre">view the code centre here</a>. I have built, iterated and continue to maintain this web application. Because it is built based on Bootstrap v5.2, and we are referencing this library in LearnX, there will be very little maintainence required due to the static nature of this library. I have begun to develop Professional Development (PD) for academic and professional staff, which includes recent research around user experience so that they can utilise this web application to build learning that meets their brief, plus is an interesting user experience for the students without the need to code.</p>
          <h4>What is the result?</h4>
          <p>Initially, students and staff were dubious of the program's success. Integrating such a broad spectrum of knowledge and skills while maintaining the standards set by UQ would result in chaos, and frustrated stakeholders. After 18 months of planning, and 10 weeks of the program being delivered, opinions of all the critical stakeholders has shifted to accept the change, and students are excited. With the advent of a project team we are also getting a much quicker feedback loop with students on content organisation and assessment. This means closing feedback loops in hours, instead of weeks or whole iterations of a course.
          <p>Students see the results of providing feedback and continue to be open with us about improving their experience. To me, this close relationship with the student base is the key to success of the change. If academics see students engaging and enjoying themselves, regardless of how much work is required to continue the program in this fashion they will do it. <strong>While there are no definitive results of success 10 weeks into the delivery</strong>, the murmurs of unwinding the changes and returning to the old delivery from academics and student reprasentatives alike have stopped.</p>

        <h1 class="p-2 text-center">Music Performance in the Pandemic</h1>
        <h3 class="text-center">Automating Google Drive for the good of music</h3>
        <h4>What was the aim of this project?</h4>
        <p>When all students and staff were sent home from Monash, music and performance students and staff faced a unique issue. So many of the courses relied on assessment of a live performance component. With the inability to be in the same space how would musicians form and perform in a band for their assessment? Even if they could, how would they submit? How would that submission be disseminated to relative markers? Enter myself as an Educational Designer in Arts working with the Music Faculty and Matt Chen, an Educational Designer from IT. Between us we used Google Suite and Apps Scripts to automate a huge amount of online work for music and drama assessment during Semester 1 of 2021, which prevented a complete shut down of the courses at the time.</p>
        <h4>Who were the stakeholders?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Music and theatre students</li>
          <li>Music and theatre staff</li>
          <li>Arts faculty senior academics and administrative staff</li>
          <li>Arts teaching support professional staff</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What was my role in the project?</h4>
        <p>I wireframed the entire onine assessment and marking process for music performance, which was then applied to the theatre courses as well. The steps involved:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sell my idea for online performance assessment to the Associate Dean for Education in Arts, Dean of the Music School and leader of Teaching Support for the Faculty of Arts.</li>
          <li>Engage Matt for support to execute the scripts required to fire off several steps automatically across the Google Suite</li>
          <li>Gather student data for assessment:<ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
          <li>Student repertoire for the 6 performance units/200 students across 6 semesters</li>
          <li>Connect students to relative markers. In performance at least 2 markers for each performance are required. A Monash staff member plus an instrumental specialist for the instrument the assessed student is playing</li>
          </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>From here, the step by step process an assessment would pass through was as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Submit their repertoire listing for their performance unit, including their instrument and any accompanying artists via a Google Form</li>
          <li>Google then automatically created a folder for each student with subfolders for each piece of their repertoire plus a subfolder for charts</li>
          <li>Each student then received an automated email linking to another form to upload their video-recorded performances</li>
          <li>Once the folders from step 2 were all populated with videos:<ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
          <li>Students were sent a view link to their Google Drive folder to submit to Moodle</li>
          <li>Matt and I were notified of the submission end date for each unit group. On this date we used data that had all the markers' names, emails, students they were to mark and instrumental specialty if they had one. We then automated injecting sharing permissions into the folders they were meant to have access to</li>
        </ul></li>
          <li>Once permissions were injected, Google sent markers were sent a document with a list of students to mark and dates that marks were due</li>
          <li>Once the date for markers to be completed was passed, students were then sent an automated email with a link to their marks and feedback</li>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: Matt, the course coordinator and I all had the ability to manually override due dates for individual students for extensions and markers to extend the individual marking deadline</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>What was the result?</h4> 
        <p>First and foremost, courses continued, students didn't get delayed, casual and contract staff didn't lose their jobs and all stakeholders gained incredible new skills to play and record together online. Secondly, the Faculty gained a highly automated process in the future for when students weren't able to perform live for whatever the reason may be. And finally, Matt, the music and theatre staff and I all gained an incredible amount of experience dealing with high stress students and technology none of us had used to this extent before.</p>
        <p>While overall compared to years where students could attend face to face, the quantitative feedback was down from an average of half a point, the comments from students in the qualitative feedabck was overall incredibly grateful to all the staff for getting the job done in an incredibly difficult time, and not delaying students' progress further.</p>
        <p>Staff were overwhelmed with what Matt and I were able to achieve using the Google Suite. That two people could automate the work that should have had a team dedicated to it was something of a miracle, the right people with the right attitude and skillset in the right place at the right time. We minimised revenue loss, job losses and time lost and created a process that was essentially reduced to clicking a few buttons at the right time to produce automations for the cohort. A win I am incredibly proud of being a music student and musician myself.</p>
